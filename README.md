PyLadies Python Web Scraping: Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium 
============================

# About this talk

The code and presentation here were done for this [PyLadies event](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesMTL/events/218661961/). The scrapers developed are pretty basic and they are not intended to work for any meetup group.

The talk is meant to introduce programmers into the scraping data world using python, processing "static" pages with BeautifulSoup and requests, or dynamic pages using Selenium webdriver.

# Requirements

You can whether install them globally:
    sudo pip install requests selenium beautifulsoup4

Or create a virtual enviroment in your folder for it:

    sudo pip install virtualenv

Run the installation script:

    ./setup_virtualenv

And run your virtual enviroment:

    source bin/activate
